## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
My favorite app and their best features are:
1. VSCO
    a. The **Manage Site** features, which allows users to seamlessly use their VSCO pictures to build a digital portfolio
    b. The lack of comments and like count makes for a more authenic user-to-user interaction
    c. Spaces that alow users to join common interest groups and share photography
2. Pinterest
    a. Boards for the user to collect similar ideas together for inspiration
    b. Integration with Amazon for easy production recommendation
    c. Search engine optimization that gives users more options on a single search
3. Fable
    a. Appealing UI/UX that makes me enjoy being on the app every day to track progress of my reading
    b. Stats features that tracks my reading trends, giving a personalized review of my reading habits

## Notes

I did not experience that many problems while building the app. I only struggled with finding Adjust Editor Options button. I will need time to get used to Xcode.
